INSTALL INSTRUCTIONS

Installing user_mail_client will make the clients update server when changes occur to users or companies,
intall the user_mail_server on the main server database to make it recieve updates from clients.

Note that user_mail_common contains fields and functions that both user_mail_client and user_mail_server share and both the modules depend on user_mail_common.

The intended purpose user_mail modules is only for dovecot/postfix. Not for regular Odoo usage.

; This is the configuration that allows user_mail module to operate:

passwd_server = http://<your main server>:8069
passwd_dbname = <your main server database>
passwd_user = <user in passwd_dbname>
passwd_passwd = <password for passwd_user>

smtp_server = <your server for outgoing mail>
smtp_port = <your smtp port eg. 25>
smtp_encryption = <your smtp encryption eg. starttls/ssl/none>

imap_host = <your server for incoming mail>
imap_port = <your imap port eg. 993>
